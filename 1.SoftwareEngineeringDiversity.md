# Software Engineering Diversity

## Application Types

* **Stand-alone applications**
  * include all necessary functionality;
  * do not need to be connected to a network.
* **Embedded**
  * software control systems managing hardware devices.
  * more embedded systems than any other type of system.
* **Entertainment**
  * Games primarily for personal use.
* **Batch processing** 批量处理
  * ex: payroll (工资单); monthly billing by a phone company.
  * Process data in large batches. 
* **Modeling and simulation**
  * For scientists and engineers to model complex physical processes or situations.
  * ex: car crashes, nuclear reactions, weather prediction.
* **Data collection**
  * Collect sensor data to send to other systems for processing.
* **Systems of systems**
  * Combine some other software systems. Ex: Car.
* **Web software**
  * Reuses many system components
  * User interfaces limited by web browser. 
* **Software as a Service**
  * Applications run remotely on the cloud. Users don't buy software but pay according to use. 
  * ex: Google docs, Amazon Web Services, etc. 
  * Cloud 'as-a-service' types:
    * Software as a Service (SaaS) 软件即服务 - SaaS是一种通过Internet提供软件的模式，用户不用再购买软件，而改用提向提供商租用基于Web的软件，来管理企业经营活动，且无需对软件进行维护，服务提供商会全权管理和维护软件。
    * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 基础设施即服务 - 指把IT基础设施作为一种服务通过网络对外提供，并根据用户对资源的实际使用量或占用量进行计费的一种服务模式。
    * Platform as a Service (PaaS) 平台即服务 - 把服务器平台作为一种服务提供的商业模式，通过网络进行程序提供的服务称之为SaaS， 而云计算时代相应的服务器平台或者开发环境作为服务进行提供就成为了PaaS。PaaS是SaaS模式的一种应用。

## General Software Issues

* Diverse Types of Systems
  * Distributed systems operate across networks(分布式系统跨网络运行): different types of computer and mobile devices. 
* Changing Environment
  * Software has to keep up with rapidly changing business and society. 
  * Must change existing software and rapidly develop new software. 
* Security and Trust
  * Software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives(软件与我们生活的各个方面交织在一起): 
    * It is essential that we can trust it. 
    * e.g. Banking, vehicle, government. 

## Diversity

* Common Need: All software projects should be professionally managed and developed. 
* Different Need: Different types of systems require different techniques.
  * Games developed in *series of playable versions*.
  * Life-critical systems need *a complete specification*.
  * No one method is better than others in all cases. 
* Select software engineering methods and tools by: 
  * type of application being developed
  * the requirements of the customers
  * the background of the development team.
