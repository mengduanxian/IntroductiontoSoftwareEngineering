# Software Engineering Diversity

## Application Types

* Stand-alone applications
  * include all necessary functionality;
  * do not need to be connected to a network.
* Embedded
  * software control systems managing hardware devices.
  * more embedded systems than any other type of system.
* Entertainment
  * Games primarily for personal use.
* Batch processing 批量处理
  * ex: payroll (工资单); monthly billing by a phone company.
  * Process data in large batches. 
* Modeling and simulation
  * For scientists and engineers to model complex physical processes or situations.
  * ex: car crashes, nuclear reactions, weather prediction.
* Data collection
  * Collect sensor data to send to other systems for processing.
* Systems of systems
  * Combine some other software systems. Ex: Car.
